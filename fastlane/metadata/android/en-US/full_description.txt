Lock device and wipe data on panic trigger.

You can use PanicKit, tile, shortcut or send broadcast message with authentication code. On
trigger, using Device Administration API, it locks device and optionally runs wipe.

Also you can limit the maximum number of failed password attempts. After the limit exceeded device
will be wiped.

The app works in Work Profile too. You can use Shelter to install risky apps and Wasted in it. Then
you can wipe this profile data with one click without wiping the whole device.

Only encrypted device may guarantee that the data will not be recoverable.
